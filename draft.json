Her works were published by her husband's newspaper and later collected into two volumes: <em>Town and Trail</em> and <em>A Woman in the West</em>. Her vignettes on daily Edmonton life offer a fascinating glimpse of a growing settler city from approximately the time period of 1905-1909. The unique sense of place in Watt's writing was a deliberate choice, as she was interested in documenting \"the now\" of things. She also added poems, photos, and drawings to enrich her sensory style.<br></div><div><br></div><div>By mapping Watt's colorful writing in the digital realm, we hope to illustrate her life in the same multimedia way she did. In particular, Watt focused on the people, places, and progress made in \nthe newly-anointed City of Edmonton. We wish to explore these three themes as well, asking who and what was in Edmonton at the time, and what a city of progress looked like in the early 1900s.</div><div><br></div><div>However, we also want to remind our viewers that Watt was a settler woman with many privileges afforded to her. As with all good historical research, we will be introducing other primary sources to supplement Watt's narratives where we can. Watt was progressive for her time in some ways and drew attention to marginalized narratives herself, but her biases are still firmly apparent. We hope that by drawing from other sources, we will be able to focus on Watt's life as a settler woman with privilege and mobility without sacrificing the context in which she lived and discussed in her own writing.</div><div><br></div><div>We have matched a coordinate to each of Watt's articles, presented in the same order she compiled her writing.

The Peace River Country, occupying territory across both Alberta and British Columbia, started&nbsp;as a remarkably small settlement with the census indicating only a population of 900 in 1911. However, the population would expand to 18,600 in 1921 and 48,000 in 1931. Regardless, this early period of Peace River's history is described as an \"economic dead end\" in Vanderhill's <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1541-0064.1963.tb00310.x?casa_token=XSo0yyEwO5wAAAAA:x7HdW5wB1fN5tKyg-ZMepc9kWfpt9UXM7PfaWWoJDuJTHIND6aWzP7TxczKrTljVLoGWE7F1ncui\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1541-0064.1963.tb00310.x?casa_token=XSo0yyEwO5wAAAAA:x7HdW5wB1fN5tKyg-ZMepc9kWfpt9UXM7PfaWWoJDuJTHIND6aWzP7TxczKrTljVLoGWE7F1ncui\">Trends in the Peace River Country</a> (1963) due to&nbsp;the detached and isolated nature of the settlement&nbsp;and inhospitable land.

The letter offers an interesting opposition to suffragettes--mainly in its suggestion that the government is made up of grandstanding individuals more interested in attention than responsibility, and so suffragettes must be clamoring for the same reasons.
